Task Manager Login System
This repository contains a Python login system project designed for a small company. The system enables users to log in, with only the manager having the capability to register new users. The program utilizes two text files: one for storing login details (usernames and passwords) and another for managing task details, including due dates, completion status, and assigned employees.
