Task_manager Login system
This is a Python login system project for a small company! This system allows users to log in, with only the manager being able to register other users. The program reads from two text files: one containing login details (usernames and passwords), and another containing task details such as due dates, completion status, and assigned employees.

With this system, users can register and save their login details, log in, and mark tasks as completed once they have finished them. The manager has additional privileges, such as the ability to change task assignments and assign them to other employees.

Additionally, the system can count the number of users who are currently logged in and the total number of registered users.
